Ludum Dare 48h compo entry

I didn't submit this entry, it was not a game.  I didn't get anywhere close to finishing. I picked the idea that I thought would be simplest - IF I could figure out the physics. I spent most of a day trying to implement a rigid body physics system into my base code ([Flaxen](https://github.com/scriptorum/flaxen)), giving up on that approach after realizing how much refactoring would be required. At that crossroads I decided I could either switch game ideas or research physics engines for Haxe. With a day left, and all my other ideas seeming more complicated to implement, I pressed on, figuring in the end I'll at least have a better working understanding of physics engines. So now I know a little about Nape, but as I shut down this LD run, my knowledge of it is still insufficient. I couldn't tell you how to get these PivotJoints hooked up properly. Harumph. I'll keep experimenting with Nape, though, because I think it'll be useful.
